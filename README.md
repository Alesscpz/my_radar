Project EPITECH my_radar

Display an animation given by a files.
Try with include/data_base/map4 as argument

The goal of this project was to detect collision with oriented bounding box and convex forms.

You need to download the CSFML librairy for running the program

In this project, we haved to render a 2D visualization panel simulating air traffic (AT).
The air traffic is a complex system with very strict rules to manage a large number of aircrafts.

For this first version of the simulation, we have to consider 2 types of entity:

    ✓ aircrafts,
    ✓ control towers.

The basic rules for the my_radar are as follows:

    ✓ aircrafts fly from given places to other ones.
    ✓ aircrafts appear on the simulation panel when they take off.
    ✓ aircrafts disappear from the simulation panel when they land on.
    ✓ aircrafts move in a straight line at given constant speeds.
    ✓ aircrafts colliding with another one is destroyed and disappear from the simulation panel.
    ✓ control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed and theycan continue on their way.
    ✓ control towers don’t move and have control areas on the map.
    ✓ control towers appear on the simulation panel at launch.
